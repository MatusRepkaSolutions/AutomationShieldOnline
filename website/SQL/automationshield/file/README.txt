SerialMonitor Application

This folder is intended to contain the built version of the SerialMonitor application (e.g., the .exe file or other compiled formats).

⚠️ Note:
The source code and build instructions are located in the `Python` folder of this repository. This directory is only meant to store the compiled output once the application is built.

To build the application, refer to the README inside the `Python` folder.
