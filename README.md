AutomationShield Online
AutomationShield Online is the result of a diploma thesis at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. It presents a modular system for controlling didactic AutomationShield devices remotely through a modern web interface, using the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi microcontroller.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project extends the AutomationShield initiative, which provides open-source, low-cost educational hardware for experimenting with control systems like PID, LQ, and MPC on various physical models.

The goal of this thesis was to lower the barrier of entry for students and educators by enabling control and visualization of AutomationShield experiments directly from a browserâ€”without the need to recompile and upload Arduino code for every change.

ðŸŽ¯ Main Features
Full-stack system for web-based control of Arduino-connected AutomationShield devices

Modular, scalable architecture using Arduino UNO R4 WiFi and PHP backend

GUI for selecting control types and entering experiment parameters

Data logging and visualization through responsive graphs

Language switching (multilingual support)

Light/Dark mode and mobile-friendly design

Integration of multiple AutomationShield models (e.g. AeroShield, FloatShield, MagnetoShield, FurutaShield)

Built-in user tutorials and documentation

ðŸ§  Educational Impact
This system is intended to support interactive learning in automation and control engineering. It can be used in both university and secondary school environments to help students learn the fundamentals of control theory through hands-on experimentsâ€”without requiring deep programming knowledge.
